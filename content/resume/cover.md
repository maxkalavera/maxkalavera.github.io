I’m a software developer with over three years of professional experience in full-stack development and a solid foundation in software engineering principles. I earned my bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering from the Autonomous University of Nuevo León, where I discovered my passion for computer science—a journey that began 15 years ago.

I have advanced proficiency in Python and JavaScript and hands-on experience with languages like C, Java, and Rust. Over the years, I’ve worked extensively with Linux distributions (Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, Arch) and developed expertise in tools like Django, React, Node.js, Redux. My roles have ranged from building APIs and optimizing SQL queries to implementing features like WebSocket communication, Firebase push notifications, manage rudimentary configurations in AWS/Heroku, manage scheduled processes and building web interfaces.

In a startup environment, I contributed to both back-end and front-end development, quickly adopting modern frameworks like React and Bootstrap to meet tight deadlines. In an enterprise setting, I focused on front-end development for e-commerce websites, collaborating in Agile/Scrum teams and refining skills in TypeScript, test-driven development (TDD), and SOLID principles.

After my last role, I took a sabbatical to recharge and pursue personal growth. During this time, I completed Coursera specializations in machine learning and graphic design, while mastering cutting-edge tools like Next.js, Jotai, Shadcn, Tailwind and Electron. Took advantage of this time to learn Latin dance (salsa, bachata, merengue), earning recognition in the local community. This experience deepened my communication, adaptability, and teamwork abilities—qualities that enhance my effectiveness in professional settings.
