I’m Max Hernandez, a software developer based in Monterrey, Nuevo León, Mexico. With over three years of professional experience in full-stack development, I possess a solid foundation in software engineering principles. I earned my bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering from the Autonomous University of Nuevo León, where I discovered my passion for computer science—a journey that began fifteen years ago.

I am deeply passionate about computer science and consider myself an experienced Linux user. Over the years, I have worked with several popular Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, and even Arch Linux, which is widely regarded as an excellent tool for learning Linux internals. I have developed code in a variety of programming languages, such as C, Java, Python, JavaScript, and Rust. While I have used some of these languages only for short periods or specific projects, I have advanced proficiency in Python and JavaScript. My experience with multiple languages has given me a broad understanding of their strengths, capabilities, and limitations.

In terms of professional experience, I spent a couple of years working at a startup, where I contributed to various areas of product development. Initially, I joined as a back-end developer, creating Django APIs. Over time, I expanded my role to include optimizing SQL queries, improving database schemas, and implementing best practices. I also implemented a variety of backend features, such as WebSocket communication, push notifications supported by Firebase, and scheduled background processes for data maintenance. Additionally, I was involved in front-end development, starting with static sites using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As the team integrated newer technologies to address tight deadlines, allow me to quickly learn to use tools like Node.js, React, Redux and Bootstrap. During this time, I also gained basic experience with AWS and Heroku, handling rudimentary configurations when necessary.

I have also worked in an enterprise context, where I spent nearly a year focused on front-end development. Most of the projects I worked on were e-commerce websites, and I gained valuable experience collaborating with teams using Agile methodologies, specifically Scrum. Working alongside highly skilled professionals, I refined my front-end skills, mastering tools like TypeScript and methodologies such as test-driven development (TDD) and SOLID principles. This experience reinforced my commitment to adhering to industry best practices.

After my last role, I took a sabbatical to focus on personal priorities and recharge. During this time, I developed valuable emotional and social skills, enhancing my ability to connect and communicate effectively with others. I also dedicated time to pursuing personal hobbies while continuing to upskill in software development. For instance, I completed courses in machine learning (Coursera Specialization) and graphic design (Coursera Specialization). Additionally, I focused on mastering some of the latest tools and technologies in software development, such as Next.js, Jotai, and Electron for front-end development. This period of growth has allowed me to stay ahead of industry trends and prepare to bring cutting-edge solutions to my next role.

During my sabbatical, I dedicated time to pursuing personal passions, including learning Latin rhythms such as salsa, bachata, and merengue. Through consistent practice and dedication, I progressed to an advanced level, earning recognition within the local dance community. This experience not only deepened my appreciation for cultural expression but also honed my ability to connect with diverse groups of people—a skill that is often less common among software developers. Dancing in a partner-based environment taught me the importance of clear communication, collaboration, and adaptability—all of which I believe enhance my ability to work effectively in team settings and build strong relationships with colleagues and clients.
