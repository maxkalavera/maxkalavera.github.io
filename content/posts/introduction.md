Hi I am Max Hernandez a software engineer and a latin rythims dancer, I open this blog to have an space to share my ideas. The main focus of this space is to have a place to share the things I learn in my daily life. It's important to have an space to communicate our ideas, is better if you have some other conscience that bounces your ideas back, but writing them and having a soliloquy it is also a good exercise.

I hope you find this space usefull and interesting, and have a nice day.
