This is the repository of my personal website, you can see the website in this site: [https://maxkalavera.github.io/](https://maxkalavera.github.io/).

## Making
The website was initially created using graphic design and UX design principles. Vectornator and Inkscape were used to create the icons and vectorized pictures on the website. Figma was used to create the site's initial prototypes or wireframes.

Prototypes that didn't make the cut.
